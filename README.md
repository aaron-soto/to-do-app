## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- SCSS with custom mixins and variables
- useState, useEffect hooks
- Material UI

### What I learned

I learned to use Material UI to allow for a more friendly user experience. Also managing an array to allow for better displaying of items for the user.

### Useful resources

- [React Js Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html) - I went straight to the source for this one and went through the react docs.
